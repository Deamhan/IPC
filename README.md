# Introducing to IPC
**IPC** is lightweight cross platform C++ Inter Process Communication library.

## License
IPC is distributed under the **MPL v2.0** License. See [LICENSE](http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/) for details.

## Library structure
IPC library consists of 5 class types: *sockets*, *engines*, *messages*, *exceptions* and *RPC*-related classes. *Socket classes* allows user to send and receive either raw data (as *raw* messages) or tuple-like type safe messages. Type safety checking can be disabled for performance reasons, maximum message size can be tuned too. Low level system specific routines for sockets are provided by *engines*. Library capabilities can be easily extended by implementing additional engines. *RPC*-related classes provide easy to use message based facility for remote procedure calls.

## Requirements
Library is written using **C++ 17** standard, so compatible compiler is required. Some library features require new enough system and headers. On *Windows* some library features (Unix sockets related classes, *Virtual (Hyper-V)* sockets) may not be available if operating system or *Windows SDK* is not new enough. On *Linux* *hv_sock* kernel module must be available if you are going to use *Hyper-V* facility.

## How to build
First of all you should run **CMake** to generate project for your build system (*CMakeLists.txt* could be found in repos root). After that you can build examples and tests by your favourite way.

## Documentation
Documentation can be generated by *doxygen* (jus run it in project directory and open *doc/html/index.html*).
